    Don't sweat it, it happens all the time. Your reset code is below -- copy it and click on the link to go to the password reset form. Assuming you did your job & I did mine, we'll have you sharing recipes again in no time.

    Oh, and by 'no time' I mean within like 10 minutes...we can't leave these reset codes lying around, so it won't work beyond that. If you run out of time, feel free to request another code.

      Your reset code is: ${resetCode}
      <a href="${RESTORE_URL}?email=${email}&code=${resetCode}">Password reset form</a>

    <p>Now go find something good to cook!</p>
